## Architecture

LunoKit is built with a modular architecture:

- **@luno-kit/core** - Core connectors and chain configurations
- **@luno-kit/react** - React hooks and providers for state management
- **@luno-kit/ui** - Pre-built UI components with theming support

This modular approach allows you to use only what you need:

- Use `@luno-kit/ui` for a complete solution with beautiful UI components
- Use `@luno-kit/react` alone if you want to build custom UI with our hooks
- Extend `@luno-kit/core` to add custom wallets or chains

## Flexible Integration Options

LunoKit now offers even more flexibility in how you integrate it with your project:

### Complete Solution

Use LunoKit's full API capabilities with built-in chain support and transaction handling:

```tsx
import { createConfig } from '@luno-kit/react'
import { polkadot } from '@luno-kit/react/chains'

const config = createConfig({
  appName: 'My Dapp',
  chains: [polkadot],
  connectors: [/* your connectors */],
})
```

### Wallet Connection Only

Use LunoKit solely for wallet connections while using your own API solution:

```tsx
import { createConfig } from '@luno-kit/react'

// No chains required when using only for wallet connection
const config = createConfig({
  appName: 'My Dapp',
  connectors: [/* your connectors */],
})
```
