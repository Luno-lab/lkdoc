- **Paseo** - Community testnet
- **Parachains** - All Polkadot and Kusama parachains

## Architecture

LunoKit is built with a modular architecture:

- **@luno-kit/core** - Core connectors and chain configurations
- **@luno-kit/react** - React hooks and providers for state management
- **@luno-kit/ui** - Pre-built UI components with theming support

This modular approach allows you to use only what you need:

- Use `@luno-kit/ui` for a complete solution with beautiful UI components
- Use `@luno-kit/react` alone if you want to build custom UI with our hooks
- Extend `@luno-kit/core` to add custom wallets or chains
